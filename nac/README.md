# NAC

## Installation

All required python packages can be found in `requirements.txt`. Install using

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contents

This package contains the implementation of the Natural Actor-Critic (NAC) algorithm.
You can find the actual implementation in `nac.py`, and available models in `model.py`.

## Usage and Examples

This section contains usage descriptions and code examples.
You can also find complete example usages of the interface in `bayesian_opt.py`, and `run_experiment.py`.

### Training
For training use `nac.nac.train(...)`. Hyperparameters are directly passed to this function, and are explained in the docstring of that function. We do not repeat this documentation here to avoid inconsistency.

#### Setting a seed
Random values are generated by `pytorch` and `numpy`. To set a seed for these libraries, use
```
torch.manual_seed(seed)
np.random.seed(seed)
```

#### Running a saved model
You can use `run_model.py` to load and run a saved model `.pt` file.
